# Profiles

Various profiles that I have built and/or modified. No warranty expressed or implied. YMMV.

## Block Sierra Installer
Prevents end users from launching the macOS Sierra installer from the Applications folder. Note that enterprising users can move the app out of the Applications folder and run it, as it is blacklisting the full path.

## Chrome Blacklist
Blocks the following Chrome VPN extensions:
